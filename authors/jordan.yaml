       “adding layers to the cake”.  Much of the natural effort in the organization is spent on chasing optimization of the core business.  This makes sense, as small improvements in a big business can have a meaningful impact.  But there is huge potential leverage to adding layers of new, complementary businesses on top of the core (aka “cake”).
