       "Do what you love. Do what you love." It's partly true but if it's business, if you start a business doing what you love, it will kill you. It will kill your passion.

       We started making these T-shirts and we'll ship them all over the world and it's like a nice surprise when customers like graduate from free to paid. You win a T-shirt and we'll ship it to you and we're getting photos back from all over like this fancy places that I hope to be able to travel to one day.

       My takeaway was humans really want to create lots of cool stuff and they want to see other people using cool stuff. That's all they want in life. If you can create a business that takes advantage of this, you might have a creative company so to speak. The thing is you have to set up a business to take advantage of this and most businesses they're set up in a weird way. They make a fundamental mistake somewhere along the way. I thought I'd explain it.

       Things go wrong (lose creativity) when that original entrepreneur, the creative guy, says,

       "You know what? I deserve a break. I'm going to delegate now. The business is running itself. I can sort of like step back a little bit. Hands off."

      Before you know it, your whole company is thinking like managers. You're not all managers but you're thinking like managers. You're defending the money machine that you made 10 years ago. No one's making new machines. No one's looking to improve it. You're just defending, defending against competition, whatever. You're just in defense mode and even worse, the creative people at the bottom, they're like, "Wow! The only way to move up in this company is to become a manager or think like a manager."

      "Don’t worry about big ideas. Just keep making the stuff." Build little things. Build prototypes. Sketch this. You want to learn a new programming language, go ahead but don’t take a 2-year course. Just learn a little bit and make something. You got 2 weeks to do it. Two weeks is the ideal timeline at least for me.

      you want to avoid meetings. You want to let people stay and work on their stuff and you need meetings every once in a while but you keep it to a minimum so people can work on stuff but then, I always call myself like a

      little bumblebee like I buzz around from desk to desk and I ask people like, "What are you working on? What are you working on? What are you working on?"

      I never praise people like, "Oh, that's cool," or anything. I just say, "What are you working on? Okay. What are you working on?" I just remember it because I think my job is to go around and say, "Oh, you're working on this but you need a logo like, oh, like Erin over there designed a logo and he doesn't have an app to give it to so like you guys should connect."

       innovation and money. You just flip the equation around. Instead of focusing on the work, you focus on the entropy or the chaos and you get a byproduct. Hope that makes some kind of sense.
