      Before you think about press, one of the things you really want to consider is who you want to reach, as well as your actual goal.

      Then target the press with that in mind.

      Press intros: The best thing to do is go to entrepreneurs who were just written about or friends who were just covered on TechCrunch, get them to introduce you to that reporter who wrote about them.

      So a lot of people ask us about PR firms. So I think in the beginning it's kind of like, everything you do in a startup, you want to do yourself. And it's actually pretty easy especially with tech press and bloggers who constantly need new things to write about.
