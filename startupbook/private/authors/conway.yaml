      VC asks: “Is this person a leader?” “Is this person rightful, focused, and obsessed by the product?”

      Then I am looking for communication skills, because if you are going to be a leader and hire a team, assuming your product is successful, you have to be a really good communicator and you have to be a born leader

      "What inspired you to create this product?"—I’m hoping that it’s based on a personal problem that that founder had and this product is the solution to that personal problem.

      You have to be decisive, the only way to make progress is to make decisions. Procrastination is the devil in startups. So no matter what you do you got to keep that ship moving. If it's decisions to hire, decisions to fire, you got to make those quickly.

      Its funny, we are obsessing over Airbnb. It’s because all three founders are as good as the other founder. That is very rare.
