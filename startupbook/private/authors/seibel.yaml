      A lot of people practice ten/thirty minute pitches or hour pitches. That's all garbage. You can get everything you need done in two minutes. One thing I like to tell founders is the more you talk, the more you have an opportunity to say something that people don't like. Talk less and it will probably be better.

      The 30 second pitch is so simple. It's three sentences. You can take your time. You can breathe when you do this. You don't have to get that much information out.

      The first is one sentence on what your company does.

      The second is in a how big is your market

      Third sentence, how much traction do you have?

      So I like to add four additional components.

      1. Unique insight: something you don't know, the aha moment in 2 sentences
      2. how do you make money? 1 sentence
      3. Then next one is team. If your team has done something particularly impressive - you need to call that out.

      So if you guys have done something that is made investors money. You want to say that. If not, then please don't go on about the awards your team has one or the PhDs - I don't care. I don't care. What we want to hear is how many founders. Hopefully between two and four. We want to here is how many them are technical? How many engineers versus business people. Hopefully it's fifty/ fifty of more engineers. We want to hear is that how long have you guys known each other? We don't want to hear that you guys met a founders dating an even three days ago. Ideally you've known each other either personally or professional for at least six months. We want hear is that you're all working full time. It's really helpful. We're all committed to this business. And what we wanna hear is how you met. That's it.
      4. the big ask.  This part you shouldn't just be like "Oh we're just raising some money." Now is time to actually use a little bit of that jargon. If you don't know that jargon - Google search it. Like it's real simple. You'll guys learn it fast.

      have you created a plan so that you can launch and grow without needing to raise a bunch of money? 95 percent of the startups that I meet can get a product to market with a very little bit of money.

      The first is you want a warm introduction from another entrepreneur preferably. Or a previous investor of yours.

      If someone who's past on your company as an investor offers you to make introductions that's kryptonite. Don't touch that.

      When you're fundraising you're on. It's a sprint. It's not a marathon. So you want to schedule all of your meetings during the same week.

      tell when you're emailing investors you getting those warm intros the investors email you back you say, "Hey we would love to set up a meeting but we're building like crazy for the next two weeks. So can we set it in that third week?"

      The last thing is one team member should be investing in fundraising full time. It shouldn't be something that takes over the whole company. Because it's very, very distracting.
