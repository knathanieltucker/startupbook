# Vision

Vision and Product Market Fit should be priority number 1 [1]

Vision is the direction of the company, it is how you organize large groups of individuals (along with a north star). [6] Thus everybody in the company should know the vision by heart. [2] And yes this means that you will repeat it a thousand times. [3]

Vision is persistence and will compete against data [4] [5] [7]
