# VC 

Raising VC is the easiest thing a startup founder is ever going to do. [3]

VC makes most of its money from outliers [1] [8]

VCs tend to be more ownership focused rather than price focused [6]

When a company is in dire straights, all the terms get renegotiated [21]

## What do VCs look for

Investors invest in strength, not lack of weakness [2]

They look for subsequent reductions in risk. [4] This means:

1. Make investment thesis [33]
2. Identify and steer into risk [34]
3. Measure the right thing and look for anomalies [35]

Focus on product rather than the pitch [5] [7] [9] [22] [23] [32]

## VC tactics

1. Explain why other VCs have turned you down and why they are mistaken [10]
2. Don't meet with associates [11]
3. Get intros from other investors or founders [12]
4. Treat investors as saying no, till you have a definite offer. [13] Check out the footnote for the basic handshake deal. [14]
5. Talk to investors in parallel rather than in serial [15]
6. Never leave an investor meeting without next steps [16]
7. The expected value of an investor that won't lead is zero [17]
8. Investors don't get extra money for being an advisor [26]
9. Give monthly updates to investors [27]
10. Set the fundraising goal as lower than you need [28]
11. Better to raise money when you are not desperate [29]
12. Go for terms that everybody understands [31]

## What should you look for

1. The basics in order are:
	1. The money you need
	2. Good investors [20] [25]
	3. Valuation [18]
2. If you get an offer from a reputable firm, just take it [19] [30]
3. Avoid valuation sensitive investors [24]
