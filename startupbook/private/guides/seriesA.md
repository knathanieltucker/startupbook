# Series A

Successful founders can sometimes go directly to a series A. [1] This is very often the case for SAAS companies [2]

One of the best ways to know series A investors is to ask for intros from seed investors (and continuing up the chain) [3]

Don't sell more than 25% of the company in phase 2 [4]
