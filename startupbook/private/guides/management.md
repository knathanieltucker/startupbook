# Management

Before 25 employees, everyone should be reporting to a founder. [1] After, the reporting structure should be clear. [1]

When you make a decision, make sure to think about it from all points of view [2]

The goal is the build a company that can run itself [3]

Have a 1 on 1 every 2 weeks. Nobody should have more than 7 direct reports [4]

It is really hard to predict who will be a good manager until you let them try [5]

## Managers

Managers have three roles: gather information, make decisions, act as role models [13]

1. Care about your employees [10]
2. Get to know your employees [11]
3. Listen to them (try quiet and loud listening) [12]

## Negotiation

1. Fight the problem not the person [1]
2. Understand the underlying interests of parties [2]
3. Outline options before you search for solutions [3]
4. Pay attention to the knowledge gap [4]
