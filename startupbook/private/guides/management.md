# Management

Before 25 employees, everyone should be reporting to a founder. [1] After, the reporting structure should be clear. [1]

When you make a decision, make sure to think about it from all points of view [2]

The goal is the build a company that can run itself [3]

Have a 1 on 1 every 2 weeks. Nobody should have more than 7 direct reports [4]

It is really hard to predict who will be a good manager until you let them try [5]
