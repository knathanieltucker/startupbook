# Culture

## What is culture

0. The first part is your [vision]({{pathFor 'guide.vision'}}) 
1. How you do things
2. Why you do things [1][9]
3. What is most unique to you [6]
4. Who you hire
	1. What they value
5. What you choose to communicate 
6. How we celebrate/punish [9]

## What does culture do

1. Culture is how you build a strong company [2]
2. The stronger the culture/trust the less process you will need (good quote) [8] [10]
	1. It is like an unwritten decision making framework [16]

## How do you have a strong culture [5]

0. Culture should be intentional [3]
1. Write it down early [1]
2. You want diversity of background, not values [4]
3. Constantly articulate your vision [7]
4. Hire the right people (especially the early ones) [11]
	1. Interview for culture fit [14] [15]

Often a good way to define it is look at all the people you have not enjoyed working with [12] Another way would be to survey your employees [13]
