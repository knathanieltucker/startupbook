# Users

{{qt 'Paul Graham' 82}}

Ultimately you need expertise in your users [24]

## Who are your first users

Ultimately it's going to be the innovators (2.5% of the curve) [1]

But for more information see [first users]({{pathFor 'guide.firstUsers'}})

## Where do you find your second round of users

You generally need to go out and get them. [6] And don't be shy when doing so. [7]

Go to the physical places where you might find them (like the post office for a shipping product) [2] [3]

And of course launch quickly. [13]


## Getting to 1 B $ of users

1. At $10, you need 100 million downloads, so you'll need either viral or user generated content [21]
2. At $100, you need 10 million downloads, so you will need viral (not like snapchat, but like evernote). Or a ton of marketing [22] [23]


## What do you do once you have some users

1. Make sure there is a way they can contact you [4]
2. Talk to your users [5] [17]
3. If you found something you don't use, rely on metrics not intuitions [8]
4. Put users ahead of monetization [9]
5. Get your users to want you to be successful [10]
6. Get people to love your product [11]
7. Treat existing users as if they are a successful marriage [12] [15] [18]. Be on guard for:
  1. Criticism in the form of: you never listen to your users
  2. Contempt for or from users
  3. Defensiveness
  4. Stonewalling, or not responding to users. [16]
8. Bring users to an aha moment [14]
9. Don't exhaust the user with the UI [20] [19]
