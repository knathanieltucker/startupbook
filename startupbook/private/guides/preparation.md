# Preparation

So there is a good deal of skepticism around whether or not you can prepare to start a startup at all. The quote that sums a lot of it up is:

{{qt 'Paul Graham' 34}}

There are certainly some definite does and don't being:

1. If you are serious about it, quit your full time job [1]
2. And don't do business school [2]

Other than that, there does seem to be some thoughts on getting startup ideas.

## Getting Startup Ideas

There seem to be two approaches to get startup ideas:

1. Be a cog in a machine [3]
2. Become somebody that has startup ideas

### Be a cog

So you are interested in a particular industry, but don't know the relevant problems:

And example of doing this is:

{{qt 'Adora Chueng' 4}}

### Become somebody that has startup ideas

{{qt 'Paul Graham' 28}}

Graham kind of talks about three ways of doing this:

#### Have a bias towards doing

{{qt 'Paul Graham' 1}}

{{qt 'Paul Graham' 14}}

#### Be at the cutting edge

{{qt 'Paul Graham' 15}}

With this caveat:

{{qt 'Paul Graham' 29}}

#### Notice your frustrations

This feels like the final hack, probably the least good way to generate ideas. But if you:

1. Notice things that frustrate you
2. And don't take advantage of the status quo

You might stumble upon something good. [4]
