# Market

Why is the market so important, well I'll let PG give the rundown:

## Big Markets

You cannot choose a niche market, it is a recipe for failure [4]

But a smaller market with high margins is the same as a larger market with low margins [9] [10]

## Parts of a market

There are five main types of users: 1) technology enthusiasts, 2) visionaries, 3) pragmatists (1/3 of market) 4) Conservatives 5) skeptics [15]

Selling to visionaries is quite different from selling to pragmatists, because their buying motives are quite different. Visionaries want change, pragmatists want improvement. [16]

Pragmatists expect to buy a whole product, not just part of one that addresses their needs. You may need to partner with other companies to address this need. [17]


## Beachhead

You will first want to target a Beachhead market in the original one. [2] [8] [11] [12] [13] [14] [18]

This market should be 1) as big as possible 2) capturable by you. [3] The same will hold true with enterprise [6]

Another good question is: how do you find out what your target market is? I don't have a good answer to that question. [7]

## Fast Moving Markets

How do you know what a fast moving market is? Well being young/a student helps [1]

## Expand your market with layers

Once you have core product market fit, a useful way to expand your business is by adding complementary businesses on top. [5]
