# Market

Why is the market so important, well I'll let PG give the rundown:

## Big Markets

You cannot choose a niche market, it is a recipe for failure [4]

But a smaller market with high margins is the same as a larger market with low margins [9] [10]


## Beachhead

You will first want to target a Beachhead market in the original one. [2] [8] [11] [12] [13] [14]

This market should be 1) as big as possible 2) capturable by you. [3] The same will hold true with enterprise [6]

Another good question is: how do you find out what your target market is? I don't have a good answer to that question. [7]

## Fast Moving Markets

How do you know what a fast moving market is? Well being young/a student helps [1]

## Expand your market with layers

Once you have core product market fit, a useful way to expand your business is by adding complementary businesses on top. [5]
