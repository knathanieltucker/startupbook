# Sales

When you start your company, you should either be building your product or talking to your users/selling [1]

And if things are not going well, sales fix everything [15]

## Who should be doing sales

The founder will be much better than a sales team. [2] 

And you will be bad at first, the first users are the hardest [13]

## Who should you sell to

Overall it should  be the 2.5% of innovators. [3] But more specifically:

1. Personal network
2. Conferences
3. Cold emails [4]
	1. See footnote on how to write cold emails [5]

## How to sell

0. Be enthusiastic [16]
1. Speak less, smile more [6]
2. Drive to a yes or a no [7] [8]
3. Use the YC deal documents [9]
4. If somebody asks for a feature then buy, either:
	1. Sign an agreement that says they will buy once done
	2. Wait for other customers to ask for the same feature [10]
5. Free trails? No, but say you can opt out after 30 days of an annual agreement [11] [14]
6. Ask for an appointment, then pitch [17]
